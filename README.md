# Portfolio

This project contains examples of the type of projects I usually work on. It's a work in progress, but currently there are examples for:

Data Engineering:
- Spinning up containers with Spark, Kafka, HDFS and JupyterHub
- Code examples for kafka producer and consumer
- Pyspark Examples for basic data processing, streaming and working with Delta Tables

LLMs 
- Serving models such as Llama 3 as an API using flask 
- Making calls to the API using the OpenAI library

Still working on: ML/Statistics examples (soon)
